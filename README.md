# Randomizer_App

This was made in android studio. When you open the app you will get 3 buttons which button "Hello" great you and tell you to count as many numbers as you wish. Those numbers are
generated on the screen when you are pressing the second button "count". Third button takes you to another screen where you will get a random number between 0 and the max number you
counted. There will also be a button which will take you back to the starter screen to try again.
